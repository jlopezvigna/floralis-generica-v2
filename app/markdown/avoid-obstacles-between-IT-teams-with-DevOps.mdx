DevOps represents a philosophy based on automation and collaboration with the main objective of delivering high business value. This process involves legacy infrastructures with newer ones built in the cloud.

Below we will tell you what this practice specifically consists of and what are the benefits of implementing it in your technology team.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that bring together software development and IT operations. Its goal is to speed up the software development lifecycle and provide continuous high-quality delivery.

It is possible to achieve this goal by optimizing response times through agile tools and methodologies. The point is to improve the creation process from when an idea is born until it goes from development to implementation. In this way, the value for the customer and the users increases remarkably because the delivery becomes faster without losing quality.

## The advantages of applying DevOps in your company

This framework brings multiple benefits to those teams that implement it.

## What are agile methodologies?

Agile methodologies allow you to quickly adapt the development of an application as changes and new needs arise. In addition, they encourage teamwork, responsibility and self-organization. Thus, the development team can base its work on the needs of the client in order to build a custom application.

All those companies that want to make a difference in their sector must master them, as they will end up being used in most companies due to their numerous advantages.

These methodologies focus much more on people and their skills than on processes or tools. Below we will detail which are the best known.

### Kanban

The [Kanban](https://www.wrike.com/kanban-guide/what-is-kanban/) method consists of organizing tasks in the form of visual cards. In technology areas, it becomes an extremely useful resource, since it helps improve workflow.

The progress of the development process is made easily visible from the possibility of identifying priorities and ordering them using labels. In this way it is very easy to know the status of each task, detecting if it is in progress or stopped at a bottleneck.

### Scrum

Scrum is vital to the DevOps implementation because it promotes collaborative work. Software teams find this method a great enabler to accelerate development projects and their corresponding quality controls.

Through sprint planning, developers can establish and improve delivery times.

### Lean Management

It is a model whose main objective is to respond to market changes in order to meet consumer demands using the least amount of resources possible.

From its implementation it is possible to save on production and distribution costs. It also increases the productivity of teams and allows business activity to be adapted to the needs of consumers.

### Extreme Programming

It is a methodology focused on communication, feedback and reuse of the developed code. Its purpose is to manage projects with flexibility, control and efficiency.

The combination of this framework with Scrum provides great control over development and a more effective implementation.
