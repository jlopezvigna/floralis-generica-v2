## Considerations for your choice and development

In recent years we have witnessed an accelerated digital transformation where e-commerce is gaining more and more strength. With these changes, of course, also comes the need to stay current in order to continue to improve the customer experience. In this sense, virtual wallets have established themselves as an indispensable solution for companies that are immersed in the [B2B sector](https://floralisgenerica.com/blog/virtual-wallets-the-key-to-B2B-commerce/) and that seek to increase their profits.

Although in this blog we have already explored the topic of digital wallets, this time we will tell you about the regulations in force in the region and how we operate in Floralis to guarantee an appropriate development.

## Why is regulation so important?

We can find a lot of information online regarding the benefits virtual wallets offer to end consumers, but how relevant is it to the **business case**?

On many occasions, before thinking about coding or developing, we have to identify the needs of the business and how to make it compatible with the standards that apply to this type of solution.

For this it is necessary to have a team of legal, accounting and business experts who articulate a solution that benefits the participating companies. The main objective of this team is to make the best decisions regarding the legal figure, the registration to the essential registries and to define the functionalities that will be offered to the participants as a consequence.

### They are secure resources

The information stored within these wallets is encrypted, that is, they guarantee the protection of the data of both the company and the consumers. This is achieved through the use of random payment codes that are not repeated. Even most applications today ask users for their biometric data to strengthen security.

Likewise, if the developments comply with the regulations that we will detail later in this article, they collaborate with the prevention of possible fraud. That is why it is so important to hire development teams that are up to date with the latest news on current regulations.

### They save time and provide transparency

Payments through virtual wallets not only help save time for users, but also for companies that manage collections. Automating these actions through software is what makes it possible.

In this way, the administration of transactions becomes much simpler and more transparent, since it allows them to be managed more quickly and efficiently.

### Boost customer loyalty

Today consumers are used to receiving benefits from the use of virtual wallets. Creating loyalty programs through a system of points that are obtained as a reward based on the number of transactions is very useful to encourage their use.

## What obligations must virtual wallets fulfill?

For example, in some regions, payment service providers (PSPs) must comply with the following regulations to reduce the risk of fraud:

-   Verify the identity of users who request the opening of an account.
-   Associate the virtual wallets to accounts or payment methods that match the owner's data.
-   Offer care for fraud claims.
-   Use tools to identify potentially suspicious patterns.
-   End-to-end encryption of transaction information.

This updated regulation is just a snippet that is focused on protecting consumers' confidential information. However, there are many more aspects to take into account when creating a financial development of this type.
