As we already know, automating the tasks of an organization consists of using technology to carry out certain operations without the need for human assistance. It can be implemented in any sector where daily tasks are repetitive.

The digital transformation allowed us to move towards an automatic approach. Nowadays managing, changing and adapting all the processes of your company is a market requirement. In addition to simplifying your daily tasks, you will have more time and energy to focus on continuous innovation.

Do you know the advantages of having these processes in your organization? Continue reading the article to know more.

## Automation in your company

Automation can be embedded and applied to network, infrastructure, cloud readiness, standard operating environments (SOEs), and even application deployment and configuration management.

Automation applications and functions can include:

-   Technologies to develop, for example: containers.
-   Work methodologies, such as DevOps.
-   Areas of work: cloud, edge computing, security, testing and monitoring or alerts are some of the examples where automation can be an invaluable asset.

## Business automation alongside digital transformation

Business automation is about coordinating business process management (BPM) and business rules management (BRM) with application development. This is how it is possible to satisfy the changing demand of the market and bet on covering internal needs.

Digital transformation is the key strategy to succeed in today's market environment and requires partnership between business and IT leaders.

### Business Process Management (BPM)

A business process is a set of activities that help a business achieve a specific goal. On the other hand, BPM is the practice with which processes are modeled, analyzed and optimized in an integral way. It applies to constant or predictable tasks and processes, as well as those that are often repeated.

BPM will allow you to evaluate your business processes to find ways to improve efficiency as well as reduce costs and errors.

### Business Rules Management (BRM)

Mature and efficient companies and organizations depend on Business Rules, a series of policies, definitions, restrictions and regulations necessary to achieve their objectives. They work when applied to certain objects of the business process, so a BRMS is the system that allows them to be centralized and managed.

It is a business management platform that makes it possible to effectively express organizational logic through a business rules engine. Match all the data with these business rules to ultimately feed a decision into business processes or systems.

## Advantages of automation in your company

Applying automated processes gives rise to a series of advantages that enhance your business. Learn about the benefits that an automation approach can bring to your company.

### Save time and money

Reduces time and specialized personnel in the execution chain. Specialists define automated processes. However, in monitoring them, we can count on a less specialized profile to carry it out. All this results in cost and time savings compared to the traditional process and the elimination of interruptions due to errors or changes in the process.

### Build trust with operational processes

It ensures that tasks are not forgotten or executed out of sequence, that the data entered is correct. In addition, it ensures that any necessary processing is carried out.

### Facilitates risk mitigation and simplifies control

Automation improves integration into data communication networks. This allows the reaction time to changes or alterations to be reduced, reducing their impact, as well as making more precise decisions.

### Improve the experience of customers and end users

Customer service is becoming more and more automated. Today it is very common to see chatbots, demand generation processes or post-sale services covered under this process. This increases the added value, while systematically reducing costs.

### Increase productivity

Another benefit of automation is that it increases competitiveness in the market. Thanks to this new paradigm, it is possible to provide a more efficient response to business needs. This is achieved from the IT area with the automation in the deployment of environments, the updating of applications and infrastructure monitoring.

## Disadvantage of automation in your company

One of the main problems is the cost. Designing an effective automation solution costs time and energy. Therefore, having an internal team dedicated to automation could be cumbersome.

On the other hand, the scope may be affected. For all implementations there are limits or spaces where it is not enough to automate. The effectiveness and safety of automation depend on how it is implemented.

Even automation can be tied to planned obsolescence. Once the automated process is put into operation, it is likely that the applied technology will not meet the objectives or will be obsolete in the short term.
