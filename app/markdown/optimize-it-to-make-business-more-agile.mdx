In recent decades, industries began to diversify the focus of their businesses, and in recent years the need for digital transformation in all industries has accelerated dramatically to respond to the challenges presented by the market. Today, companies need to optimize their processes, increase productivity and increase revenue, while meeting industry requirements and customer demand for faster deliveries.

In this context, the main challenges are faced by IT professionals who must provide quality services for organizations to achieve commercial success and remain competitive, but maintaining a low cost. This is how, on the digital transformation journey, organizations seek to achieve a balance between innovation and taking advantage of the traditional. But, since a large part of their budget is allocated to maintaining the existing infrastructure, without a balance, they hardly have the financial resources to innovate.

This is why at Floralis Gen√©rica we are clear that these days, modern organizations need to have dynamic environments and effective IT solutions that accelerate their business. For this reason, we must jointly face the following potential challenges in the IT areas:

-   Legacy infrastructures, in some cases obsolete and that do not meet the demands of the business.
-   Requirements by internal and external users that become demands for IT area managers to have services similar to those offered by the main public cloud providers (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS).
-   New security threats.
-   High costs of licenses, maintenance and technical support.

Therefore, to solve these challenges, at Floralis we accompany organizations to take the IT optimization journey, which is a fundamental point since it allows reducing costs and increasing efficiency. In addition to reducing risks and increasing stability, it makes it possible to design platforms that promote portability.

It is key to note that open source technologies, like **Red Hat**, integrate with any existing infrastructure while preparing the business for future innovations. In this way, the organization will be able to transfer workloads to secure, modern and cost-effective platforms. You will also get greater flexibility, scalability and reduced implementation time, achieving business acceleration.

In order to convert an expanding ecosystem into a true hybrid environment, an intelligent and secure operating system is required, which involves all workloads to reach a consistency that makes the combination of the physical environment with the public-private cloud viable, and free.

Therefore, to meet their objectives, IT professionals require modern applications, connectivity and control. As a solution to this premise, an open source operating system becomes essential and, at a business level, we can talk about [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux). Not only is it an intelligent operating system that provides the necessary foundation to enter the hybrid era while running any application in various environments, but it is also the shortcut to innovation.

It also provides security and coordinates all parties, including community projects, hardware manufacturers, and cloud providers, and integrates them into a single functional system, ready to support enterprise workloads.
