When a card's owner disclaims a charge to their bank, it is usually the merchant who ends up paying the price. Regrettably, many of these disputes are caused by fraud. In addition to the lost funds due to the reversal of the transaction, it is necessary to consider other charges, for example, production and logistics. Therefore, the trader can lose even twice the amount of the transaction.

## How is the process after a fraud of this style?

Unfortunately, customers often file illegitimate claims, either because of a real problem or because of malice. These problems are often called credit card dispute fraud, chargeback fraud, or friendly fraud.

When a cardholder disputes a transaction, their issuing bank asks them questions about the details of the transaction and the reason for the dispute. If it seems legitimate, the bank initiates the return of the total amount invested by the client.

When a chargeback is initiated, a temporary credit is issued to the cardholder in the amount of the transaction. At the same time, the merchant's account is debited for the same amount plus a chargeback fee. If a customer is indeed a victim of credit card fraud, the merchant simply has to accept the chargeback. However, if the merchant believes the chargeback is illegitimate, he has proof of sale.

Through a process called representation, the merchant must present evidence that the transaction was legitimate and the chargeback is not. In short, too many chargebacks can cost a merchant significant revenue and damage their reputation with payment processors, banks, and credit card networks.

### Who has the advantage in a fraud situation?

For cardholders, requesting a chargeback has few disadvantages, even if they have to stretch the truth to justify it to the bank. Usually, in the worst case, the merchant successfully represents the charge and does not recover the money from him.

Smart merchants can blacklist a cardholder from shopping with them again, but the consequences are rarely harsher than that. While banks sometimes close accounts that repeatedly abuse the dispute process, criminal prosecution for credit card dispute fraud is rare.

## How to prevent fraud?

The best thing that can be done is to have a pre- or post-transaction registration process that conditions the operation until it is completed. In these processes, some identity validations are requested that limit the ignorance of the charges, making it much more difficult for a fraud to be committed or for a cardholder to be encouraged to "stretch the truth" and commit a "friendly fraud".

Among the measures that can be taken in these processes are:

-   Obtaining the client's IP address: with it you can limit the locations that will allow new transactions to be made from strange locations.
-   Obtaining and automatically comparing data with the help of the database of the entity in charge of generating a national registry of citizens in your country.
-   Proof of life that corroborates that the person making the transaction is who they say they are.
-   [KYC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp): it is a practice that allows verifying the identity of customers in compliance with legal requirements and regulations.

Another complementary measure is to blacklist people with a history of previous scams, meaning orders from them will never be accepted in the future. At least that way, they can't attack you a second time.

## The consequences of suffering credit card fraud in your e-commerce

Credit card dispute fraud is actually several different problems that share the same name. It can come from good customers with bad habits, consumers who are genuinely confused and need better communication from the merchant at some point in the process, and actual malicious scammers.

Treating this type of fraud simply as a cost of doing business can add significant revenue and cause the ratio of chargebacks to transactions to skyrocket to dangerous levels.

These chargebacks can be a struggle and you win if you have evidence that the basis of the dispute is false, but that will not change their effect on the chargeback rate.

In addition, collecting evidence and filing chargeback statements requires considerable time and effort, time that most merchants would prefer to spend on their core business operations.
