## What is ITSM?

The acronym ITSM refers to Information Technology Service Management. Its main objective is to improve the quality of these services to ensure that they meet the needs of the business and, consequently, of its customers.

This approach includes all those activities and processes that support a service during its life cycle, that is, service management, change management, incident management, asset management and knowledge management.
